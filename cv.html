					While many of these sound cliche, they are real skills I've
					noticed are effective in my years of solving problems in
					teams. Thank you to our robotics team Team4Robotics!
				</p>
				<h1 class="script">Teamwork skills</h1>
				<p>Nothing better than being a part of a team!</p>
				<div class="card-container">
					<div class="card">
						<h2>Listening</h2>
						<p>Listening carefully and asking a lot questions</p>
					</div>
					<div class="card">
						<h2>Communication</h2>
						<p>
							Clear and precise communication benefits all. A team
							member needs to be able to present their thoughts
							effectively
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="card">
						<h2>Team resource management</h2>
						<p>
							We're all different. Learning how to take advantage
							of that is one of the key steps to making a well
							functioning team
						</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<h1 class="script">Problem-solving skills</h1>
				<p>
					Problem-solving is at the heart of what I do. More complex,
					more better.
				</p>
				<div class="card-container">
					<div class="card">
						<h2>Subdivision</h2>
						<p>
							Don't tackle everything at once, it's too
							complicated. Instead, divide and isolate the
							smallest problems and solve them individually. That
							how you pull through in lengthty projects!
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="card">
						<h2>Brainstorming and discussion</h2>
						<p>
							Relating to teamwork skills, take advantage of the
							ideas different people. Eventually, choose the
							solution as a team after a discussion!
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="card">
						<h2>Resources</h2>
						<p>
							Besides team resources, others like time and money
							often have an effect on which solutions are best
							suited. A quick fix may not be ideal, and in the
							best case not needed (as it was planned for
							earlier), but in the moment it may be what's needed!
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="card">
						<h2>Testing</h2>
						<p>
							Solutions must be thoroughly tested, even in
							unexpected conditions. Proper testing can alleviate
							many future problems!
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="card">
						<h2>Documenation</h2>
						<p>
							Often overlooked, documenation is the key to making
							things run in the future.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="card">
						<h2>Iteration</h2>
						<p>
							Once you complete all the steps above, don't stop
							there! Repeat and repeat, refine the solution.
							Eventually, the gains will return diminishing
							results and you need to know when to stop!
						</p>

							My experience in C and C++ comes mostly from my

							Version control became an obvious pitfall in 2018

							a sync conflict in our Dropbox folder! Previously,
							version control had been done with naming files
